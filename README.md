# minimon.py
A simple serial monitor script.
Use ```minimon.py -h``` for an overview of options.

## Tips & Tricks
If the serial port response clutters your terminal output use a named
pipe to capture the output in a separate window.

## Known Issues
The script was never tested on anything but Linux. There is absolutely
no guarantee that it will run as expected on any other operating system.
This is in particular true for the port scanning feature which is platform
dependent.
